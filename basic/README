# Simple User Management Application in Go

This is a command-line program written in Go that demonstrates various concepts including language basics, concurrency, error handling, packages and modules, testing, interfaces and polymorphism, web development, database access, and performance optimization.

## Features

- Defines a simple struct representing a user with fields for ID, name, and email.
- Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on users using an in-memory data store.
- Uses goroutines to perform concurrent CRUD operations on users.
- Implements error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid input or data not found.
- Uses packages to organize the code into separate modules, such as one package for user management and another for database access.
- Includes unit tests for functions using the testing package to ensure good test coverage.
- Defines an interface for the user management module and uses it to enable polymorphic behavior.
- Implements a simple web server using the Echo framework to expose CRUD operations as RESTful endpoints.
- Integrates a simple SQLite database using the database/sql package for persistent storage.
- Utilizes pprof package for performance optimization by exposing profiling endpoints.
